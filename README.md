# Neurodynamics_SS2022_models

Jupyter notebook with code to model a singel neuron with given parameters.

## Description

The jupyter notebook contains three neuronal models, namely the Hodgkin and Huxley model, the Izhikevich model and the leaky integrate and fire model, and plots those for comparison.
The implementation of the calculations is loosely based on the interactive neuron model simulator by Devrim Celik (https://github.com/Devrim-Celik/interactive_neuron_model_simulator.git).
We changed the code such that it was convenient to plot it with matplotlib and chose parameters to represent a regular spiking model with 15 spikes. The plots underline the different behavior and should be helpful to compare the three models.
